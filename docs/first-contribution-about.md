One of the difficult things is the start. If you have never contributed
to an open source project, where do you begin. You probably have modified
a configuration file, added a hal component or just want to document
something that you deem missing.

You probably already read about about contributing on the page 
[about contributing][2] but how does one do that??? This howto is
meant to guide you thru the first part of getting somebody else enjoy the
work you have done.

This howto assumes there is a working Machinekit installation from which
you make your additions. There should be a directory called ```machinekit``` 
in yout=r home directory. It's also assumed that this is a git clone of the
[Machinekit][3] repository on Github.
